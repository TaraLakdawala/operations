# About
Essential resources for Delphi's operations.

In addition to critical automation infrastructure, this repo contains common
development resources, including the following documentation for Delphi
developers:

- [backend development guide](docs/backend_development.md)
- [frontend development guide](docs/frontend_development.md)

# Branch `campus`

This branch contains a modified `deploy.json` which enables deploying the
`operations` repo on non-midas hosts. The branch should otherwise be identical
to `master`.
